In the future, it may help to introduce programming basics at the beginning using examples that do not depend on an existing knowledge of r functions (for example, one of the demo loops was using "paste0" which we did not cover, and the course moved so quickly I couldn't stop to google it in order to figure out wtf the sample loop was even doing).,yes,1503435455
