I think it could be helpful to have a few task sessions where participants attempt something on their own (e.g., take this new data set, do some wrangling and create these four types of plots each with different labels and/or colors...), then discuss solutions or confusion with a neighbor, then reconvene as a group and discuss different solutions people came up with.  ,yes,1503437844
