Grad student,25,IO,TRUE,TRUE,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,NULL,more about the 'language' that is R,regarding the terminology and language, it might be helpful for there to be some homework prior to the session. E.g., make sure you have the updated version of R studio, these packages installed. Additionally, more annotation on some of the code with what each specific function means would be helpful. Some of that was in powerpoints, but going back and forth between the two while attempting to follow along proved difficult. Overall, an extremely positive experience and something of value for all who attended. Very thankful to Rick, Michael & James for their efforts!,yes,1503456149
